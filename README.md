# Rust miniprojects

![worflow status](https://github.com/brycewhit13/rust-miniprojects/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

## Motivation

This repo is meant to track my progress as I develop my rust skills starting from nothing. The goal is to add a new CLI project developed in rust every week. Below is a list of all the projects I have completed so far and a short description of what it does.

## Projects

- [currency-converter](https://github.com/brycewhit13/rust-miniprojects/tree/main/currency-converter): A CLI that takes two currencies as an input and outputs the conversion from the first currency to the second
- [coding-contest](https://github.com/brycewhit13/rust-miniprojects/tree/main/coding-contest): A CLI that gets current and upcoming coding competitions from different sites.
- [digital-clock](https://github.com/brycewhit13/rust-miniprojects/tree/main/digital-clock): A CLI that acts as a digital clock. Currently it shows your local time with hopes of expanding it to accept any timezone moving forward.
- [hackernews-rs](https://github.com/brycewhit13/rust-miniprojects/tree/main/hackernews-rs): A CLI that scrapes articles from Hacker News directly from your terminal
- [int_conversion](https://github.com/brycewhit13/rust-miniprojects/tree/main/int_conversion): A CLI that takes an integer and prints the results in binary, hex, and octal.
- [iris-classification](https://github.com/brycewhit13/rust-miniprojects/tree/main/iris-classification): A small example of comparing two decision tree models on their ability to classify the iris dataset.
- [mouse-hacker](https://github.com/brycewhit13/rust-miniprojects/tree/main/mouse-hacker): A toy CLI that moves your mouse in a triangle a certian number of times. A mini-project to get used to interacting with the mouse/keyboard in Rust.
- [pig-latin](https://github.com/brycewhit13/rust-miniprojects/tree/main/pig-latin): A CLI that takes a word/sentence as an input and returns the output converted to pig latin.
- [random-password](https://github.com/brycewhit13/rust-miniprojects/tree/main/random-password): A CLI that generates a random password. This password defaults to 12 characters long and always includes at least one number, symbol, and capital latter. The user can specify how short/long they want the password to be.
- [rust-python-comparison](https://github.com/brycewhit13/rust-miniprojects/tree/main/rust-python-comparison): A CLI that allows you to compare the speed of python and rust for a couple different tasks
