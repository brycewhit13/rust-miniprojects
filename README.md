# Rust miniprojects

![worflow status](https://github.com/brycewhit13/rust-miniprojects/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

## Motivation

This repo is meant to track my progress as I develop my rust skills starting from nothing. The goal is to add a new CLI project developed in rust every week. Below is a list of all the projects I have completed so far and a short description of what it does.

## Projects

- **currency-converter**: A CLI that takes two currencies as an input and outputs the conversion from the first currency to the second
- **digital-clock**: A CLI that acts as a digital clock. Currently it shows your local time with hopes of expanding it to accept any timezone moving forward.
- **iris-classification**: A small example of comparing two decision tree models on their ability to classify the iris dataset.
- **mouse-hacker**: A toy CLI that moves your mouse in a triangle a certian number of times. A mini-project to get used to interacting with the mouse/keyboard in Rust.
- **pig-latin**: A CLI that takes a word/sentence as an input and returns the output converted to pig latin.
- **random-password**: A CLI that generates a random password. This password defaults to 12 characters long and always includes at least one number, symbol, and capital latter. The user can specify how short/long they want the password to be.
