# rust-miniprojects
## Motivation
This repo is meant to track my progress as I develop my rust skills starting from nothing. The goal is to add a new CLI project developed in rust every week. Below is a list of all the projects I have completed so far and a short description of what it does.

## Projects
- **random-password**: a CLI that generates a random password. This password defaults to 12 characters long and always includes at least one number, symbol, and capital latter. The user can specify how short/long they want the password to be.
