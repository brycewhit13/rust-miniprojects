# Fibonacci

## Description

This is a very simple program that calculates the nth fibonacci number both iteratively and recursively. The goal of this project is simply to learn more about Rust and get experience with recursion in Rust.

## How to run

1. cd into the directory with `cd fibonacci`
2. run `cargo run -- -n [NUM]` where `-n` is the nth number you want to retrieve. By default it is set to 10.
