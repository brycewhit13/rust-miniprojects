# pig-latin

## Description
This project is a command-line tool that takes a sentence (or word) as an argument and translates it to pig latin. The translated sentence is printed to the terminal in pig latin. If you do not pass a sentence, the program will complain and nothing will be translated. 

## How to Run 
1) cd into `pig-latin`
2) Run the following command: `cargo run -- --sentence "[INSERT SENTENCE HERE]"`
    - NOTE: You need the quotation marks if you are using translating more than one word, otherwise it will throw an error. 

If you need help or more information, please run the following command: `cargo run -- --help`

## Next Steps
- Allow the program to take a file as an input and output the translation in a different file
